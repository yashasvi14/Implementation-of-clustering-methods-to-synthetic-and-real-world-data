# Implementation-of-clustering-methods-to-synthetic-and-real-world-data
The objective of the project is to implement different clustering methods to synthetic and real-world data and validate using external and internal validation techniques. Following tasks were performed on the datasets
1. Used K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to generate clusters
2. Evaluated the performance of the clustering algorithm using external validation metrics
3. Plotted in 2D/3D the data points for each dataset and colored them according to the original class
4. Plotted in 2D/3D the data points for each dataset and colored them according to the class allocated by the clustering algorithm
